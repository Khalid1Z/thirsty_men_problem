I propose the following solution to the deadlock problem:
The visitors will immediately rush to watch how he would prepare his cup first. In this instance, there will be only one winner. The winner has no incentive to cheat, and he wants to break the tie so he can drink which makes him trustworthy. He will establishe a variety of regulations based on elimination, and the loser must instantly place his cup and the last will win. Why must the rules be based on elimination? Because if a loser complains and refuses to place his cup, he will constantly be in a poor position, and the other players will force him.
